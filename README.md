## What to Expect

When Visiting the application's website:
- The user is presented with a welcome sign similar to that of a menu.
- The user is given two options: create a new burger, or devour one of the existing burgers.
- If the user chooses to add a new burger, they will type in the burger name and click submit.
- Once submit has been clicked, the burger is added to the list of Burgers ready to be devoured.
- When the user sees a burger that looks tasty, they can click the "Devour It!" button next to the burger name.
- Once the "Devour It!" button has been clicked, the burger is moved to the "Devoured Burgers" list with no button next to it.

## Lessons Learned

Learning how to communicate with MySQL without manually creating a database was quite a relief. Handlebars was a complete learning curve in itself, it was similar to re-learning how to write HTML without the ability to actually view what was being rendered. Back-end has prooven to be very powerful and I am excited to see what other things it can do.
